Feel free to modify the layout to make it visually appealing.
There are 2 dropdowns - “Coinsurance plan”, and “PPO Plan”. For simplicity, assume a choice of one for each.
Preferably use React/Node.
What front-end architecture did you choose - SPA, micro-frontends, isomorphic, static page, jamstack etc - and why? (mail deepak@32health.care)
